# Website for Izzmo.com

This is the code repository for izzmo.com. There are 3 main branches: vanillajs, aurelia, and react.

These branches serve as an experiment to see the differences between each framework. This also serves as a thought experiment on how to better make lighweight-vanilla JavaScript.
